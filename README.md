# VKontakte Removing Icon

After redesigning of VKontakte the removing icon for posts was placed to the post's dropdown menu, which makes it not comfortable to hide each readed post. The user-script for Tampermonkey adds additional removing icon for all posts outside of dropdown menu, so now there's no need of additional actions.
